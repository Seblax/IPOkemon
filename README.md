# IPOkemon
This is a college project for the course Human-Computer Interaction (IPO – Interacción Persona-Ordenador in Spanish).

IPOkemon is an oversimplified Pokémon battle simulator without states, fields, or complex mechanics. It includes all Pokémon up to Generation 5, including variants and special forms like Charizard X and Y with their specific stats.

The game also features shiny Pokémon, Mega Evolutions, around 32 battle stages, and more than 5 different battle themes.

Everything is coded entirely in JavaScript and CSS, as it was a requirement for the course.
